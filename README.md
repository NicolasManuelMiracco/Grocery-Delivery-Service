# Grocery-Delivery-Service

One-line description: A Python class-based system to simulate a grocery delivery application with operations to manage stores, items, and orders.

Summary: This script defines a system for a grocery delivery service, implementing classes for `Store`, `Item`, `Order`, and `GroceryDeliveryApp`. The `GroceryDeliveryApp` class acts as the central manager, allowing the addition of stores and items, and handling operations like editing and deleting items. Each `Store` can hold multiple `Item` objects, which contain names and prices. The system supports creating orders, which involves simulating order processing stages from pending to delivered, and provides functions to display order details and list items within a store. The functionality allows adding stores and items dynamically, editing item prices, removing items, processing orders, and displaying comprehensive details about stores' inventories and specific orders. This simulated environment is useful for understanding basic inventory and order management systems in a commercial setting.
